<h3>Uploading and Processing PDFs</h3>
To begin, you can upload one or more PDF files that you want to process.
Once you have uploaded the PDFs, the application will start processing them. Please note that the processing might take some time, as it utilizes the HuggingFace Transformers, which are known for their accuracy but can be slightly slow. The positive aspect is that this service is entirely free for you to use!

<h3>Chatbot Interaction</h3>
After the PDFs have been successfully processed, you can interact with the chatbot. The chatbot has been trained on the data extracted from the processed PDFs. Feel free to ask any questions related to the content of the uploaded PDFs, and the chatbot will do its best to provide you with relevant answers.
